# StrellaMusic
Strella Music is an app tailored specifically for my girlfriend using P5JS and creating an audio visualizer using FFT to show
the songs that we as a couple love and hold near and dear. This will play the audio clips using the Spotify API and implementing
that into a database in mongodb. This will then be output to its own port using a VM.
